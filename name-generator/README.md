# Name Generator

This experiment takes names of pages in the current universe and prompts GPT-3 to generate more 
names in that style.

## Usage in Notebook.ai

Names change over time, in different cultures, and on different planets. A sci-fi story is often going to have wildly different-sounding names than a historial romance piece.

By inferring a style from the inclusion of existing names within the current universe, this experiment can generate additional names that fit to the world.

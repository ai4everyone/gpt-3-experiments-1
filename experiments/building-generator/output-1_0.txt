Orsham Manor
Orsham Manor is a large manor a few minutes from downtown in the woods. It is a mansion of glass, mirror, and beauty. It's a hot spot for parties in the evening. However, the house is set on fire and burns down at midnight, around the stroke of midnight, so the events are sometimes closed to the public, for reasons unknown. It's common for arson investigators to start the investigation first thing in the morning, but somehow the building is always a charred mess.

The Ravenswood District
This was the last and most recent section to be built, due to its distance and hilly terrain from the main district and its dense forest that would eventually grow closer together to create a barricade. It's mostly residential with the only notable building being St. Bryar's Church.

Omen House
The Omen House is an orphanage for mid-teen teens to young adults that have been orphaned through tragedy. Though founded with good intentions, it's now used as a training ground by criminal organizations who pay for the orphans keep. All of the orphans are required to commit crimes in order to maintain themselves in the group.
L. G. Luke Stadium
A large, publicly owned sportsplex whose athletic fields include football, soccer, and baseball. There's also a training facility for athletes. It was built in the middle of an open field in a patch of woods that still exist to this day, though the stadium itself has grown much taller.

Langhold Courthouse
City Hall is where the town Mayor, and major political players, meet with other influential figures and Representatives from other areas. They talk about dealings, trade, and make alliances and beneficial deals with each other. It is entirely made of brick, as is common in Lumeria.

Flower Street
A long street lined with florists and flower shops, built many decades ago to celebrate the local Daeru culture. Those who live there grow flowers in their homes and sell them to shops and use their day off to dress elegantly and pull wagons of flowers all over the city.

Unmarked Church
Not an uncommon building, an unmarked church is just that - a place of worship for followers of a god or goddess that do not wish to draw any attention to their beliefs. Unmarked churches are typically found in deep rural areas, but one is located on the outskirts of town, alone on its own, made of polished marble.
The Cathedral Ridge
The Ridge is the largest and oldest cemetery in the city and is overgrown by a large collection of shady trees. 
Due to its many sudden and tragic deaths, a large owl and snake population inhabit the place. A massive stone obelisk stands at the center.

Academy of Dreams
This splendid old-fashioned building has a marble staircase that leads to the turquoise door on the side of the second floor. It's an academy for aspiring arcane casters that teaches magic theory and gives new casters a chance to craft their first focus. A large, white marble bookcase can be found on the bottom floor. This school was built when magic was still common and it was widely accepted and understood.

Eastern District Courthouse
The courthouse is in the heart of Vezna's Eastern District. The courthouse itself is three stories tall and can be seen approaching from anywhere in the district. Its outer structure is designed like a giant clock and has a large bell. The bell rings out 8 hourly times and noon on weekdays.

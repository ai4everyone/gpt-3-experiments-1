The town was known throughout the region for its detailed architecture and vast array of shops, guilds, offices, and other buildings. Every street was packed with buildings as far as the eye could see. These are just some of the notable buildings in the town.

Twist House
A well-known training house for amateur organized crime in the area. The Twist House operates in the public as an orphanage but requires the children it adopts to train in pickpocketing and sleight of hand. It is three stories tall, in an old cathedral that is no longer used. However, all of the original stained glass is still in perfect condition.

Newell Justice Center
The Newell Justice Center is a detention center for troubled teens and offers rehabilitation, classes, and job training to those within its care. It's a large, square building on the outside of town made entirely of stone masonry, with a well-known brick road that leads to it.

Tower of Spite
The Tower of Spite is home to the local Darcian witch convent. It was built hundreds of years ago in secret, but its height eventually led to its discovery from afar. The tower stretches into the heavens and has hundreds of lookout points that stretch into the sky like branches on a tree.

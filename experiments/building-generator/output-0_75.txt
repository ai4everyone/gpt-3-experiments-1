O'Neill Mansion
The O'Neill Mansion is a rather plain-looking, stone building with two floors, a basement, and an attic. It sits on a large plot of land with several other houses and a small creek running through it. The mansion is owned by a rich merchant who moved to town several years ago and built the home. He and his family are rarely seen. The townspeople often gossip that they're involved in illegal activity and that the building is a front.

Broken Bridge
The Broken Bridge is a bridge that has been broken down for decades. It's the only remaining structure from the previous city that existed before Njorndr and the first ever version of Bridgefort. The Broken Bridge is one of the oldest remaining structures in the city, but no one knows how old it really is.

Evergreen Cemetery
One of the most notorious graveyards in the region, it's a massive graveyard that sits on a hill just outside of the town's wall. It's known as the Evergreen Cemetery because of the large number of trees that surround it, which are left undisturbed in order to avoid a haunting. The graves within the cemetery date back hundreds of years, and some of the more expensive ones are well-kept, while others are falling apart.

Castle Bains
The Bains Family lives in the Castle Bains. It is a two-story stone masonry building, but is also home to the local high school and sports teams. Castle Bains is known for its expensive imported architecture, which can be found all over the castle. It is also the only castle in the region to have a ballroom.

Silver Woods
The Silver Woods is a vast expanse of trees to the northeast of the city. It is named as such for the massive amounts of silver within the tree's trunks and leaves. The silver in the woods is not native to the area, but is from an old dwarven mine. The silver acts as a natural repellent to beasts and bandits.

Lucky O'Toole's

The Scribe
The Scribe is the town's one and only newspaper. Its publisher, a man by the name of Bartholomew, is known for being an incredibly passionate man. The newspaper has made a name for itself in recent years for its "true news" campaign, in which it exclusively publishes articles that aren't backed by the nobility.

The Snaketown Pub
This local bar is run by a drow named Selzynn. It has a long, dark history of serving as a safe house for those who needed a place to hide from the law. It is known for its cheap ale and it's nightly performances by bards and other musicians.

Alley of Legends
The Alley of Legends is a well-known shopping area for those who want to purchase an illegal or rare item. It is a network of tight alleyways that are a mile long and filled with shady characters. Most who visit this area know how to navigate it and don't leave until they have what they need.

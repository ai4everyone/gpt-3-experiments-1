Ability: Speedster
Strength: You can move at speeds even normally inanimate objects cannot move at. Leaving little to no trail of your passing while moving at such speeds. On top of which you are immune to the negative effects of having high speed or a force passed onto you. (Getting crushed between two objects would simply break your bones, where there would be no air resistance making it feel as if you were walking through air at regular speed). Your body automatically adjusts your sensitive organs to prevent them from getting crushed by impact, inertia, or exceeding speed and acceleration. Lastly, your perception is also adapted to high speeds, where people moving at regular speed look as if they were standing still.
Weakness: Your speed drops to a minimum if your brain waves go below 50 cycles per second.

Ability: Precognition
Strength: You have the ability to see glimpses of events that have either happened, are happening or might happen in the future.
Weakness: The greater the distance in time from the present, the more blurry your visions become.

Ability: Juxta-Corporeality
Strength: A special bond with another being makes your quasi-physical body appear in visual and tactile hallucinations to them on demand.
Ability: Omnipolar Perception
Strength: You perceive all objects regardless of facing, illumination and polarized light.

Ability: Eyes of the Head
Strength: While all eyes are on the front of your body, you have the eyes on your shoulders which provide you with peripheral vision in all directions.
Strength: The back two of your arms are identical to the front two, whereas a normal person takes advantage of the length, you have eight powerful arms each with their own full range of motion.
Weakness: You can only have four of your arms active at any given time, and must switch between them very quickly in order to keep up the flow of power.

Ability: Prey Instinct
Strength: You have the ability to perceive your surroundings though the vision of your prey.
Weakness: Your perception is cloudy while you are in human form.

Ability: Multi-lingual
Strength: You have the ability to speak two languages simultaneously. In order to speak in one language, you must take time to stop and concentrate. When you stop speaking English or your other language, then your opposite language begins to de-materialize, starting from the mouth and moving to the ears as you are speaking the opposite language.

Ability: One of Us
"You were the only one left standing. But it didn't finish you off. You are special, a winner in this new reality. Rifts to another world had begun to open, and strange creatures and magic from those other worlds spilled out onto ours. Usually, those creatures were strong and savage enough to kill whoever they encountered. Some even formed alliances with local power-hungry sociopaths.
Weakness: You have lost everything from your life prior to the successful use of Grief council.

Ability: Energy Drain
Strength: You can absorb energy by touch and convert it to other forms or expel it out with force: even the energy of light or physical vibrations will work.
Weakness: Your touch can drain energy from living things too.

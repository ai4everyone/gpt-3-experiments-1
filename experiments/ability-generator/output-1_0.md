Player qualities can be chosen two at a time, representing cohorts that joined the game. They come with two qualities, one for their real life person, and one for the game.

Ability: Animal Magnetism
Strength: You can command any animal, no matter how complex its instincts.
Reversed weakness: The animals under your command instinctively recognize you as their true ruler and destroy you unless you have another survival aspect or otherwise become the dominant creature.

Ability: Nature sense
Strength: You comprehend the speech and mannerisms of all manner of fauna to such an extent that you can fool even expert animal behaviorists if they are unaware of your special ability.
weakness: You accidentally assume animal behavior and mannerisms when you lose self control (scream, cry, etc.).

Ability: Psionic Smoke Bomb
Strength: you can use mental energy to create a smoke screen that will confuse any other psionic masterminds.

Ability: Lust Link
Strength: You're linked to the lust center of all other people that you can see. If someone becomes horny, you feel it inside you as well.
Strength: You can transfer the feeling of lust that you feel to others (if you don't feel any, you can simulate it using a meditation skill).
Weakness: Your lust can't be turned down; it's essentially the other character's lust now, up to the weight of 1,000 pounds. To others is the lust yours. However, when the other character loses the lust link, the lust returns to you.

Ability: Technopathy
Strength: Your mind has the ability to override any electronic machine, be it a computer, radio, or some kind of vehicle.
Weakness: Your mind becomes so preoccupied by the electronics that you cannot engage in conversation with humans.

Ability: Animal Attraction
Strength: You have the ability to attract animals to do your bidding.
Weakness: If you neglect to feed or care for the animals, they will hunt and kill you in a very humiliating fashion.

Ability: Phoenix Affinity
Strength: If you are killed you will resurrect within 10 seconds.
Weakness: After your first resurrection your heart will forever belong to a dream born phoenix. If anyone who shares a heart with the phoenix wants you they could easily steal it. People start treating you as a long lost family member, no matter how much you deny this. People start believing that you are aging in reverse. This gets socially awkward.
Failure: Rise of the Phoenix decides to run for public office using your name.

Ability: Kinesthesis
Strength: You are able to locomote with extreme ease as a graceful blur, moving faster than normal.
Weakness: Every century, you have to watch a piece of yourself unravel and fly off like a fluttering leaf.

Ability: Fistsmith
Strength: You have super-human strength in your hands.
Weakness: All damage you do is concentrated to your hands, rendering you unable to use them for any fine tasks.

Race: Osrah
Description: Osrah are lanky figure-eaterish humanoids. Their heads and limbs are long and skinny while the center of their body thick and robust, making them appear as if they only have a torso. It's not uncommon for Osrah to weave planks of wood, stone, or other more flexible materials into their joints to allow for greater movement. They are known to have an excellent sense of smell and many Osrah are gluttons. Those that do not feast on others exclusively roughly only feast on dead trees.

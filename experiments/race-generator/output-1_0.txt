Creapso: A Taboo is the ruler of a nation on Taloo. To do something considered taboo, whether in a negative or positive way (i.e. "truly caring for your people") is a crime punishable by death. This is the reason that Jagar became a pariah as he was preparing to tell the humans about the Creapse (leader of Taloo) taboo of using magic on their Tama plants.

Race: Nightwing
Description: Nightwings are small, bat-like, harmless creatures that crave bloatsprites. They are sometimes used as transportation by nightwings, typically in the form of a makeshift saddle.

Race: Beta (a kind of Centaur, actually)
Description: Betas are bipedal creatures that have hooves instead of feet. Their feet are capable of becoming flat and hard like spikes to allow them to run on any surface. They have the bodies of humans but the tails of horses. Like bicycles or unicorns, they need to be paired with another Beta in order to pass over the boundaries of wonderlands.

Race: Amal
Description: Amal are enormous tortoise-like creatures with thick shells covering their bodies. They are covered in horns and spikes on their backs and heads when it is time for them to transition to adulthood, and have smooth shells prior. When an Amal reaches adulthood, they stay that way until they die.
Physically, Draga are amongst the strongest creatures in the world. They excel in endurance and can continue fighting through a significant amount of wounds. While they are fast during their early years, Draga eventually become significantly slower. This is also true of their high level of flexibility which tapers off later in the Draga's life. Draga also have no distinction between hot and cold climate. Queimada Draga are grassland dwelling Draga who are brightly coloured and can usually be found with other Dragons. They rely more on their agility rather than their endurance and show different physical signs of strength than those found in jungle dwelling Draga.

The world of Falcrest is ruled over by a single omnipotent deity referred to as Recluse. Despite Recluse granting all people the power of magic, the citizens of Falcrest live mostly in the wilderness in political city-state fiefdoms. Many of the city-states worship Recluse by building their own giant statues in Recluse's image.

Race: Starshadow
Description: Starshadows are capable of rendering themselves seemingly invisible to human eyes. They are wingless faeries that are wrapped completely in dark blue hair. They are quite taciturn and nearly impossible to understand due to their tendency to speak only in murmurs.

Race: Rashka
Description: Rashka are bipedal, large reptiles that live in herds. They have long claws on their pointing 'fingers' and these tend to be the preferred weapons. They are as aggressive and territorial as wyverns.

Race: Nuvek
Description: Nuveks are salamander like creatures that come in multiple colors. They often lose limbs in fights and grow them back eventually.

Race: Leigor
Description: Leigors look similar to Draga, but are slimmer. They have slightly longer tails and usually have more luxurious hair than Draga. Leigors tend to make up for their lack of strength and speed with their tongues, often seen persuading others to do things for them or badgering their compatriots.

A popular board game played by both Humans and their Lupin slaves. The game is played on a square board, divided into alternating colored fields. Each player controls three pawns of their color and a "Wizard", which can be moved across the board and rotated to face any direction. The objective is to occupy the most territory. Players take turns moving their pawns. If a pawn is moved onto an unoccupied field of the same color as the pawn, it is "captured" and removed from the game. A pawn may only move one space at a time, unless a Wizard is moved to its location. In that case, it is moved to the Wizard's location. The Wizard may move as many spaces as desired, and rotate to any desired direction after each move.

Sword: Agrax's Razor
Named after the great warrior, Agrax, who dedicated his life to the kingdom of Ancalien, Agrax's Razor is a sword that is literally a battle of two against one. With a black grip held in place between two blades, the wielder can attack either high or low, making it a valued weapon among falcon knights.

Spear: Beautifully-Forged Lance
Eyeing this stunningly flawless spear with doubt, many whoh have gazed upon its perfect surface believe it to be a cold weapon, forged and artificially sharpened by man. Little do they know, its perfect construction was crafted by natural forces.

Harp: Relic Harp

The humans of Elyria each have a racial mentality. This determines what kind of man they are. For example, Richardson is a pious man, Celestine is an idiot, and Colin Adcott is an amoral man. Each of these men are human, but they lack certain aspects of their race.

Short Sword:The Baneflected
An aged short sword originally seen in History books as a weapon of the gods turned The Baneflected in the wrong hands can easily be your end. Legend tells of a tribesman once changing the direction of a cyclone using only a small - but very sharp- piece of metal.

Life Sketch
Designed by Fireblade, this blade is a perfect contradiction. At first glance, the cross-section appears to be a typical adze-type blade, but on the back of the blade there is a closer resemblance to "kage-ri", the small, thinner katana used for close combat. The two sides of the blade are constructed to eliminate excess weight, but they don’t convey enough force to be of much combat worth. Instead, the drawing side contains a single paper-thin layer of Lightningweave silk, making it so sharp that it makes no sound when it draws “life-sketches” of any moving object. While the blade may be cute, the frozen effect of hitting anything on the “sketch” with the blade will stop any brain function within two seconds.

Shield: Backshield
The Backshield is a shield in reverse form, made out of flexible toricorn scales that combine to form a circular green plate. Its sheer size and weight causes the dragest of enemies to stumble, but requires great strength to wield.

Sword: Sword of Destruction
Created by the Feltor wizard Nekortiz, every scrape and dent is 400 consecutive strikes on the same pebble. Supposedly, anyone who were to touch the blade would risk contracting leprosy or lupus.
Any glove can be worn, each having some sort of special abilities:

Key:Wooden Key
The Wooden key was forged on the tree Yggdrasil, and houses the soul of the god Yum. It is said to belong to the uncle of the King of Falus, and was passed down from generation to generation. It's been kept inside the royal vaults ever since Falus was abandoned, and to this day the key remains an object of mystery. The falusian royal family is currently searching for its rightful owner, who is apparently said to possess infinite potential.

Dagger: Plasma Dagger
The Plasma dagger has a permanently unstable "on" switch. Although its extremely sharp edge is kept sharp by a monomolecular current running through the metal, it would probably be unwise to shake hands with someone who carries this dagger on his belt.
QuickFire Spear
Made from titanium dioxide copper wires, the QuickFire Spear uses anti-gravitational fields made by its silver alloy to propel itself forward. This allows broad usage of the weapon against enemies.
Holy Lance
From a warrior of the Ten Commandments, this weapon exudes holy light and fire. It possesses the properties of a non-elemental spear and can be utilized as a blade in the event that the spearhead breaks.
Blasting Drum
Easily mistaken for a bucket, this reveals itself to be a high-frequency capacitor in combat when the Electric Deity strikes it. This launches a highly concentrated amount of electricity to its targets.
This katana is completely stainless. It is a combination of a high-frequency superconductor and indestrucible materials known to be found on other planets. The Sword of Decline is capable of cutting through dimensions to attack enemies who are usually behind their target.
2028 Panzerfaust
Experimentation of space-folding weapons was the 20th century's peak achievement. The creation of this gun was also complicated and difficult, but it resulted in a rocket-like blast that can be controlled from the wielder effectively. 
Tranquilizer Golgo
This weapon was specifically created for the purpose of non-fatality incapacitation. Using tranquilizer capsules placed in a defendable, tactical manner, the Tranquilizer Golgo is more of defensive artillery than an offensive weapon.
Drain Cutlass
This Cutlass fires drain energy when they are struck against each other. The energy also wraps around the user and puts them in the good graces of the Virus Deity. 

Sword: Midnight Cutter
The Halfling forged this sword out of an unknown material and placed within it a multitude of glowing pox light
sources. These resources are what give off a dark light in the darkness.
Kaiser Blade
The Emperor forged this sword himself with the help of SABLE in his defense of the country from monsters
and evils. It is made from a strange metal called "S" and reinforced with studded leather hardened by alchemical liquid.


Sword: Vampireblade
Made from the bones of a long dead vampire, the Vampireblade is bloodthirsty and wanton to sustain its master's life.

Sword: Skullblade
The Skullblade was forged from a large skull excavated from a nearby pyramid in 1301. The skull is that of a mega-videogame monster that bested over 50,000 intergalactic warriors at once. It doesn't really have any special properties, outside of possible haunting myths.

Katana: Darkfire
The Darkfire Katana was created during the Mongol Invasions of Japan as an
insult to the legitimacy of the Shogun in power. It's hollow so it was really more of a club
than a hand-to-hand weapon. The Darkfire Katana is deadly to anyone standing near
who carries the gene for heterochromia.

This is a list of all the gamers who had not, up until June 2013, made their own stances in the series:
Sword: Windblade
The story of the Windblade was forever lost with its creator, the tribal posthuman Avithanil-n'tarev'as. The elf in-training who finds his sword may have gotten it from his college or came across it while foraging in the forests. The skinny blade defies the laws of physics â€“ one end is heavier than the other and gives it its exclusive ability to alter
Its maximum strength and refraction depending on how unevenly it is balanced.

Sword: Thunderblade
In ancient times, the Thunderblade was created by fusing rock and metal to the severed arm of the Hydra. The blade can deliver exceptionally powerful lightning attacks, and can also function as a lightning rod.

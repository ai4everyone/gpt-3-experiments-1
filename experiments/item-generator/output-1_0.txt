Known as , the statuettes are the water elementals who serve the goddess Wen-chih Su Hsin after her transformation from Wen-chih Kuan-yin. It is rather unlikely that they could transform into a dragon considering that Wen-chih has already visited the mortal realm and is unlikely to allowed her servant to make the same trip, being unable to master such a task. They could, however, combine water from different sources. In total, there are 37 statues spread along 3 country borders. Intructions to complete the puzzle are written on the stone tablet. After the end of the royal family line, only 7 of the statues were idolized. When the statues had to be moved to a less safe location during World War II, four of the seven including Big, Little, Middle, and Flying Water were collected in one place on a mountain ascribed by locals as the Dragon's Back. It took Wen-lien Chen, Huan-tsung Yen and his people a week to locate.

Qin Shi Huang was born on 26th of April 257BC (O.S) in the imperial palace located in Xiqiaoshan hill, Lintong, Yanmen, Shaanxi province, he was physically different from his peers. He was good looking and kindhearted. According to legend, Huang is the only person in Chinese history to become a monarch without the backing or material resources of a family dynasty. The story of how he became emperor of the Qin Dynasty is that in 245BC when he was 9 years old, he was sent to live in the city of Xianyang which belonged to the Wei kingdom. His father, lord of the Qin was trying to win the support of the Wei king to save the village of Qin from subjugation by the other nearby contending states, Qi and Chu. In Xianyang Huang became friends with the sons of the prince of Wei, who provided Huang with knowledge and resources such as the art of war and etiquette. According to the findings of historical experts, the bond between the lord of the Qin and the king of Wei was too intimate. Yang shot his cook, he did not fulfil his promise to his father.
Huang with his brilliant strategy rescued his father's village and the king from the besieging rebel states of the time: Chu and Qi. During this time he received military training during which he learned from the other officers on the basis of the knowledge he learned from Wei's prince of Wei. Soon Huang was well known in both Qi and Chu states for his patriotic approach to save his homeland with its unique ruling techniques. He, amongst others were accomplished with horse and chariot racing. The most immediate threat to the Qin was the conquests of Chu. He fought alongside 6 other generals. Their first fight was said to have been fought 11 to one. They won and pursued the opposing forces for many miles into their own land. Gary Yourofsky called Huang "the cruelest tyrant in human history" and "the greatest killer of human beings ever."

D'Avor's Caves
D'Avor's Caves is a large cave system that was discovered in the northern mountains. It is a series of caves that are very deep, with large underground lakes and rivers. There are several entrances to the caves, but the only entrance that is not guarded by a cave troll is the one in the northern mountains.

Broken Bridge
The Broken Bridge is a bridge that has been broken down for decades. It's the only remaining structure from the previous city that existed before Njorndr and the first ever version of Bridgefort. The Broken Bridge is one of the oldest remaining structures in the city, but no one knows how old it really is.

Evergreen Cemetery
One of the most notorious graveyards in the region, it's a massive graveyard that sits on a hill just outside of the town's wall. It's known as the Evergreen Cemetery because of the large number of trees that surround it, which are left undisturbed in order to avoid a haunting. The graves within the cemetery date back hundreds of years, and some of the more expensive ones are well-kept, while others are falling apart.

God's Rock
It's uncertain whether God's Rock is a naturally occurring boulder or something celestial, but its size outclasses other boulders in the area by a magnitude of over one hundred times larger. The grey stone is smooth and almost perfectly spherical, eternally resting in a valley between two ridges.

Stonefinger Field
Stonefinger Field is a large field of naturally occuring stalagmites that stick out into the air, like stone fingers stretching to the sky.

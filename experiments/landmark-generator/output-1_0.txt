Gnomehome
Gnomehome is a forested plateau south of Bridgefort. It has several large basalt towers and obelisks that jut out, resembling walls of some race's fortress. Over the years it has been a hive for wood elven children, an observatory, and a templar camp.

Big Rock Desert
Big Rock Desert is a plain of desert that consists of a large quantity of naturally-occurring stones. Boulders are visible from miles on end, reaching up to 30 feet tall in some places, protruding from the sand like rocks decaying out of the palm of a hand. It's a popular spot to practice stone-handling when there aren't any caves to train in.

Lake Kolesterol
Lake Kolesterol is a lake that's been rumored to have a dragon living within it. This is probably the case, as many of the lights and sounds that appear can't be explained otherwise, but few people have come forth with accounts of actually seeing the dragon.

Jameson Estate
The Jameson Estate is a large estate that sits in the town's center, in the Empire Square. It was named after the owner, Thomas James, and was mostly unused after the previous owners passed and Thomas changed careers from a merchant to an ambassador. The Jameson Estate has been given to groups like the Winter Caldervale Brotherhood Of Wizardry to use, with the requirement that the events go on without a hitch, and are well-advertised to the public.

Lake Lake
Lake Lake is the largest natural body of water in Fremennik Province, and is a landmark of great pride for the locals. It serves as a source of water for the town during the dryer seasons. The lake watershed starts in the north in small streams, and there are heavily-treed, rustic coves. There are also numbers of deer, bears, and Boars in the area. Historically, only Dorek Cove and Koktva had refused to concede to Njorndr's rule and take his taxes. From the ascent to the top of a hill to the west of Lake Lake, visitors have a nice view of the town.

Harmun Woods
Harmun Woods, which is also known as the Goddess Woods or the Sacred Woods, is a large thick forest in the northern mountains that run alongside the eastern side of the civilised area of Bridgefort. It's known as one of the last remaining healthy forests in the nearby areas surrounding the city, and it's a popular place for students of The King's Academy to take a break from lectures.

Skull Lake
Near the border, right outside of Stinndarr's Walls, there seems to be a rocky, gaba-like lake bed. The large rock formations form a basin around a central lake, with a single path cut into the stone. The lake only has one source of water scattered directly onto it. There are also several upright skeletons, both human and orcs, that seem to be floating respectfully to the east side of the lake bed.

Old Steel Bridges
During the old times before Njorndr, when Bridgefort was a rebel town waiting to overthrow Valog the Deadly, the town's keep was separated from the town by a bridge that was destroyed by Njorndr. The old stone footbridges below the keep are covered by several generations of amount of moss and ivy, but spans the small chasms so the base of the keep can be accessed.

Northern Woodlands
The Northern Woodlands are the northernmost reaches of Hill Montgomery. There are few settlements in the area, and aside from the various wildlife, there are several nature spirits that roam the land. The western border is marked by an intersecting marker on the prevailing compass point tiling the remain of the city. The southern boundary and indeed, a vast majority of the northern boundaries is marked by the sweeping Doran Subregion.

Silver Pond
Silver Pond is a large pond south of the city. The pond receives its name from its unusual colour, said to be the silver reflection of the deadly pale moon through the waters' surface, Sapphire Aurora.

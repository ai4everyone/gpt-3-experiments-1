The proliferation of the Wachanga culture is closely linked to the growth and development of the Malawian transportation industry and telecommunications systems.

Spell: Rock Slide
Element: Earth
Incantation: "Nda-yah-da n-do-wu-wan mu-ah-be-ok"
Description:" The caster puts one finger from each hand on the ground and then pulls their hands inuvlightly away from each other as they chant the incantation. They can direct the effect by thrusting their hands further in the direction the rocks should move. One might also reproduce a specific object, name or memory by guiding the rocks around it.

Spell: Bezoar
Element: Earth
Incantation: "Page 77, C-Section, volume 48, B-182"
Description: The incantation is actually a prophecy that made by one of the Founder Magicians during a lost battle. The last part of the incantation is his desire to drink juice. After reciting all but the last part of the prophecy the caster must swallow and momentarily hold their breath before finally vocalizing the prophecy's end (i.e. "Juice"). After this they should exhale and then inhale the Final Result Juice.

Spell: Skullmolt
Element: Dark
Incantation: "Gwatsu-wa"
Description: Smash the target's head until it comes apart like sugru, then reassemble shards into a humanoid skull as large as the target. It possesses significant strength and stamina despite its physical weakness.

Spell: Minor Green Dealing
Element: Plant or Animal
Incantation: "Stixis trickas umbiwa exiamus estmorrow"
Description: Chant the incantation to turn an ordinary, naturally-sprouting plant into a carnivorous plant. The plant acts like a mouth with extending vines and darts from its leaves and vines. The more the caster concentrates, the fewer the vines and darts appear in each plant.

Spell: Dig

Spell: Blinding Ray
Element: Cosmic
Incantation: "Saya-ras gah-su"
Description: An experienced magician type can concentrate their mind and thoughts to conjure and project a beam of energy from their outstretched fingers. The beam can be made to spin at a rapid speed, violently enough to create a small twister. The twister can be used to throw objects to pierce land and water based targets from a distance, or to distract an opponent by making patterns.

Spell: Absorb
Element: Water
Incantation: "Dorobosa, morobosa"
Description: After preparing a large receptacle, the caster may channel conjured water into the bin to be contained. The water is stored in its form, but will begin casting a one-foot dome somewhere within a 50-foot radius over the location it's being stored. This dome's water is then "absorbable" by casting a spell of similar ability onto it. This water screens a substantial amount of the scrying visual effects, such as EMP Lathes, but will rot away at good magic items. As long as the dome is stable, it will continue to remain above its location.

Spell: Broom Flight
Element: Dust
Incantation: "Fu-na-shi, ku-na-shi, ri-na-shi"
Description: In order to achieve flight, the caster must recite the incantation while a stick of straw is held above a person's head. The stick of straw must be swung in a circular motion while the spell is recited, and the caster can then mount the broom like a horse would mount a horse, by kicking off their feet and having the broom support their weight. The faster the caster recites the incantation, the faster the broom will move. 

Spell: Rain
Element: Fire
Incantation: "Amsa-adam ma-ia"
Description: The caster should hold their palm above their head with one hand while they chant and focus on the clouds above. All will become terribly still as they repeat the incantation while slowly moving their outstretched hand across the clouds' surface for a minute, until silent raindrops will begin to fall.

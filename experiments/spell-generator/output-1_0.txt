Spell: Shout of the Nightingale

Spell: Dark Matter
Element: Doom
Incantation: "Trop aki fon shagkur du nugi shid netrup ru shugari merfar nuit mo yaim u fagi as ak-at ten kebabi"
Temporal Distance: As long as it is dark
Description: The user closes their eyes and spreads their arms wide after reciting the incantation. Once the light intensity of the surrounding environment is intangible, planets, stars, and galaxies can be perceived to be flowing from the edges of the darkness. This is the caster's cue that it is time for them to return to the otherworld. The proximity of the nearby realm then transforms into black matter, which can then be brought into the user's arms and can be manipulated as a weapon. Upon a "strike", the black matter will immediately dematerialize and, "hit" the space in front of the user. This has the effect of distorting the space-time immediately surrounding the "strike", enveloping everything into the otherworld.

Spell: Silent Movement
Incantation: "Shuu-shi-su
"
Description: This spell enables the caster to move about unnoticed. While it only works while the caster is on the move, some individuals may have advanced to a point where they are able to utilize this technique while standing still. In this case, a caster will be able to sneak up on an individual whispering, "Shuu-shi-su".

Spell: Density Manipulation
Element: Water
Incantation: "Jamila-shu swoshi-su ti-di-man"
Description: With both palms planted firmly on a solid block of ice, the caster should quickly recite the incantation while focusing on the desired density. The caster will begin to push their palms down into the ice to compress it, until it reaches the desired density. The caster should proceed to move their hands sideways and pry the ice block to dislodge it and raise it.

Spell: Telekinesis
Element: Space
Incantation: "U-dali u-dali she-su"
Description: After reciting the spell, the caster should imagine the object they're trying to levitate towards them. The caster should then use their mind to guide the object through the air. The object will then perform a straight trajectory towards the caster's line of thought. As the object comes closer to the caster, the object will naturally begin to descend, and continue to do so until passing through the caster's line of thought to deliver itself to the caster's grasp. As in all casting methods, a complete focus is required for this spell to work most reliably.

Spell: Healing Hands
Element: Cosmic
Incantation: n/a
Description: The caster places her hands over a subject in need of healing, recites the spell and provides mental images of the body's functions so she can feel the body as a system and attempt to balance the overall flow. This spell is mainly used to provide overall maintenance and minor restorations for both organic and synthetic lifeforms.

Spell: Argonaut's Sails
Element: Water
Incantation: ""
Description: The caster hums the incantation and then pours water into their cupped hands, from there, they have to see the water vaporize into the air. If it is successful, the incantation must be repeated until the formation of Argonaut's Sails takes form. These sails can be stored in a pocket and easily summoned during transportation or moving. The caster can rehearse evocation gestures so they can execute the gesture without incantation for a short duration 

Spell: Fortress Wall
Element: Earth
Incantation: "Dan-ha-ri-na-hen"
Description: Using quick twitches and arm motions, the caster summons a wave of dirt that can be used to create a wall around people and objects to shield them from danger.

Spell: Healing
Element: Water
Incantation: "Homu awyu keishimu ioni shaga su"
Description: Chanting this incantation will pace the flow of bio- and psyenergy at the target body part to heal wounds faster. Because it encourages the body's natural healing process, this incantation cannot be used to heal limbs severed from the torso, or portions of flesh afflicted with petrification. This can, however, heal burns and other scars, if the caster is able to maintain proper proximity.

Spell: Seduction
Element: Wind
Incantation: "Soy-jin sou ba-jou maji"
Description: While chanting the incantation the caster will blow air upwards in a forceful gust which will surround the intended target. This gust is then enchanted to be irresistible and will slowly begin spreading towards its target.

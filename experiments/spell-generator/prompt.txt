Spell: Fireblast
Element: Fire
Incantation: "Alla-hu fire-jon buu"
Description: The caster makes a fist and holds it tightly with their other hand while chanting the incantation. Their fist will glow red-hot until it combusts into a ball of flame, which can then be "punched" to launch a single fireball. The fireball will explode when making contact with a solid object.

Spell: Clairvoyance
Element: Cosmic
Incantation: "Du-jin sho-jo al-fu min-dun rek"
Description: A skilled celestial magician can enter a meditative state and subconsciously chant the incantation to initiate an out-of-body experience. While they're unable to interact with the physical world in this form, they are able to move around and observe the world from other vantage points.

Spell: Stone Wall
Element: Earth
Incantation: "Mwasha-shu swoshi-su bindushi wan"
Description: With both palms planted firmly on a dirt ground, the caster should repeat the incantation a number of times proportional to the depth and width of the stone wall they would like to conjure. While reciting, the caster should point their mind in the direction the wall should form and visualize its size.

Spell: Frostbite
Element: Water
Incantation: "Kwita-machi-eo"
Description: The caster must chant the incantation and then spit water from their mouth, which will immediately freeze into weightless ice shards upon contact with the air. To achieve sharp shards, water should be spit through teeth in small, separated streams.

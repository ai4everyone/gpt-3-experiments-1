Name: Goldstew
Description: A delicious stew made from the beaks of Goldbills, which gives the stew a shimmering golden color.
Recipe: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, then add 2-4 Goldbill beaks dependendant on how potent you want the flavor to be. Add chives, onions, flavored beetles, and/or a potato for flavor. Stew for at least 6 hours, then serve hot. Pairs well with corn crackers.


Name: Hamnur
Description: Hamnur is a delicacy of the Sumen peoples, prepared by mixing a pot of multiple kinds of meats with the acidic water of the Purple River. The water bonds the meats together at an atomic level, which can then be sliced or prepared in a variety of multi-meat dishes.
Recipe: Slice at least two different types of meat into thin strips to maximize exposed surface area while waiting for a pot of Purple Water to boil. Add all of the meat at once, stirring briefly. Let the pot continue to boil for fifteen minutes per pound of meat. Do not stir during this time. When the meat is ready, drain the water and cover the meat in a heavy salting to dry it, then leave it out in a dry area for at least one day but no more than three.

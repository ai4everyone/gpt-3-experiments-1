Name: Apple MeadDescription: An alcoholic beverage made of apples, apple juice, and mead.
Recipe: Pour coconut oil or vegetable oil into a large pot, then add a single sixth of Wilding kit and toss in an apple core. Let the mixture simmer for three to four hours, in which time the apple flesh will be cooked and the seed will be fully decomposed. To speed up the process, add a small amount of bread mold at the very beginning. Once the core is completely broken down, add the contents of four to five different recipes for mead depending on how potent you want the liquor to be. Add additional bread mold while simmering, as it imparts flavor during the fermentation process and prevents the yeast from coloring the entire pot. Cover the mixture with a lid immediately and let it sit for one to three days. Strain the juice and discard the solid basis of the concoction, then chill the new batch in a cool cupboard. Enjoy!

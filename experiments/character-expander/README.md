# Character Expander

This experiment takes a character as input and outputs additional information about that character. Please see `prompt.txt` to view the prompt used and how to structure the character's information being used as input. The final character in the prompt (Joe Clementz) is the one being expanded upon, while previous characters are used as an example of what other fields are available to expound with.

## Usage in Notebook.ai

By including other characters from the same universe in Notebook.ai, the expander is able to reference those other characters. Additionally, the same fields (and style of answer) that other characters use can be reused on this character, even if users have customized their character template to add or remove non-standard fields.

============================================

As of 6/28/17, a follow-up to the novel entitled ""The Dying Light: A Short Story"" has been written by David Videcette, and is available on Amazon.


**Note: The novel's latest iteration is entitled The Arrival of Doyle.

The Arrival of Doyle is the story of a naive young man named Doyle Stoddard who moves into Whitechapel, a small town loosely based on the real town of Weaver's Needle, Oregon. Doyle is the only surviving member of U.R.S. 3001, a spaceship full of a successful utopia and a spaceship that barely made it out of a supermassive black hole. After being thrown into an interplanetary hedge, Doyle and the rest of the crew crash land onto the nearest planet which, unbeknownst to them, was occupied by another human society.

The Arrival of Doyle is a tale about identity, coping, and being forced into situations you are unfamiliar with or aren't ready for.

Prejudice: Joe hates debates, especially when he takes part in them. He isn't used to being verbally aggressive with people, so he prefers when other's just do what he says.

Prejudices: Joe is driven by either the stern rule of survival or the angry tyranny of his bosses. He has a hard time trusting others and tends to keep his possessions close at hand.

He originally planned on getting surgery for his wife, but the family's extreme financial state has lead Joe to work long hours to otherwise save up the money. A permanent job at the factory is especially needed as Joe is planning on retiring from the O'Brim energy plant -- provided he lives to see such a day.
